# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on analyzing the original flutter_sequencer package and establishing our own updated version called flutter_multitracker. We are in the initial phase of:

1. **Understanding the original plugin architecture** and implementation details
2. **Setting up the basic project structure** for our updated version
3. **Identifying compatibility issues** with the latest Flutter versions
4. **Planning the implementation strategy** for each component

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Initialization**: Created the basic flutter_multitracker package structure
2. **Model Definitions**: Implemented initial versions of the core models:
   - Instrument
   - Sequence
   - Track
   - Note
   - Automation
3. **Platform Interface**: Defined the basic platform interface for the plugin
4. **Method Channel Setup**: Created the method channel implementation for platform communication

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Native Implementation**:
   - Android: Implement sfizz integration with Android audio APIs
   - iOS: Implement sfizz integration with AVAudioEngine

2. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   - Instrument loading and management
   - Sequence creation and note management
   - Playback control and state management
   - Volume automation

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Create unit tests for Dart API
   - Create integration tests for platform implementations
   - Manual testing with various instruments and sequences

4. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Integration instructions

5. **Example App Development**:
   - Create a comprehensive example app demonstrating all features
   - Include various usage scenarios (drum machine, sequencer, instrument player)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Design**:
   - Should we maintain API compatibility with flutter_sequencer or create a cleaner new API?
   - How should we handle asynchronous operations and error states?
   - What level of abstraction is appropriate for the plugin?

2. **Native Implementation**:
   - How to handle cross-platform differences in audio subsystems?
   - What is the most efficient way to integrate sfizz on both platforms?
   - How to manage memory efficiently for large sample libraries?

3. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Which features from the original plugin are most critical to implement first?
   - Which new features would add the most value?
   - What are the minimum requirements for a viable first release?

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - How to minimize audio latency?
   - How to handle CPU and memory constraints on less powerful devices?
   - What optimizations can be made for the audio engine?

5. **Platform Support**:
   - What minimum platform versions should we target?
   - How to handle platform-specific features (e.g., AudioUnit on iOS)?
   - How to ensure consistent behavior across platforms?
