## Current Work Focus

We are currently working on implementing the Flutter Multitracker plugin with a focus on:

1. **Fixing Native Implementation Issues**:
   - Fixing compilation and linking errors in the native C++ code
   - Implementing missing methods required for proper functionality
   - Fixing duplicate member variables and naming conflicts
   - Ensuring consistent method signatures across the codebase

2. **FFI Integration**:
   - Implementing direct native code access through Dart FFI
   - Creating proper bindings for the C++ audio engine
   - Ensuring thread-safe communication between Dart and native code

3. **Android Compatibility Issues**:
   - Updating build.gradle files for proper minSdkVersion (23+)
   - Fixing C++ implementation with missing constructors
   - Implementing proper NDK configuration
   - Ensuring OpenSL ES integration works correctly

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implementing dedicated audio thread management
   - Optimizing memory usage for sample loading
   - Implementing efficient thread communication patterns

- Troubleshooting native audio engine initialization on Android
- Fixing JNI method bridging between Kotlin and C++ 
- Ensuring proper asset handling in the example app
- Implementing a robust fallback audio system
- Extending debug logging to identify audio engine issues

## Recent Changes

1. **Fixed C++ Compilation and Linking Errors**:
   - Fixed duplicate member variables:
     - Renamed int16_t* m_currentBuffer to m_currentBufferPtr to avoid conflict 
     - Properly initialized m_currentBufferPtr and updated all relevant code
     - Added proper memory cleanup in the AudioEngine destructor
   - Fixed unused parameter warnings:
     - Added /* unused */ annotations to function parameters
     - Fixed usage of m_currentBufferPtr in audio processing code
   - Fixed missing method implementations:
     - Implemented stopAllNotes() method for all instruments 
     - Implemented stopAllNotes(int instrumentId) method for specific instrument
   - Eliminated linker errors and successfully built the native code

2. **Build Configuration Updates**:
   - Updated Android build.gradle files for compatibility
   - Fixed C++ compilation issues in native code
   - Verified successful native library build

3. **Example App Enhancement**:
   - Updated example app to use the latest API
   - Added loading state handling
   - Improved error reporting to users

4. **Architecture Refinement**:
   - Switched from Method Channels to FFI for performance-critical operations
   - Implemented unified C++ core for cross-platform consistency
   - Designed improved threading model for audio processing

### Audio Engine Fixes
- Fixed JNI method name mismatch for `setupAudioEngine` to correctly reference `com.raybsou.flutter_multitracker.SimpleAudioEngine`
- Added automatic creation of a default sine wave instrument during initialization
- Fixed asset paths in `AudioHelper` to consistently use the 'assets/' prefix
- Added extensive debug logging in the native code and Kotlin bridge
- Modified `SimpleAudioEngine` to use both native and fallback approaches
- Enhanced error handling with full stack traces in Kotlin code

### Previous C++ Fixes
- Fixed a duplicate member variable issue by renaming `m_currentBuffer` to `m_currentBufferPtr`
- Properly initialized and used `m_currentBufferPtr` in the `processNextBuffer()` method
- Implemented missing `stopAllNotes()` and `stopAllNotes(int instrumentId)` methods
- Fixed various unused parameter warnings with `/* unused */` annotations
- Ensured method signatures match between declarations and implementations

### UI Improvements
- Modified piano key handling to provide visual feedback even when audio engine isn't initialized
- Improved debug logging in the Dart code for asset loading and playback
- Added fallback to `AudioHelper` when native audio engine fails

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Current Build**:
   - Test the compiled native library on actual devices
   - Verify proper functionality of audio engine components
   - Identify any remaining runtime issues

2. **Complete Audio Engine Implementation**:
   - Implement proper audio rendering and callback system
   - Ensure proper synchronization in multi-threaded contexts
   - Verify memory management and prevent leaks

3. **Complete FFI Implementation**:
   - Implement timeout handling for all native calls
   - Implement proper resource management and cleanup
   - Add comprehensive error handling and reporting

4. **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
   - Complete OpenSL ES integration for Android
   - Implement AVAudioEngine integration for iOS
   - Ensure consistent behavior across platforms

5. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Test on multiple devices and Flutter versions
   - Complete API documentation
   - Provide comprehensive usage examples

1. Continue debugging OpenSL ES initialization issues on Android
2. Test on a physical Android device to see if OpenGL ES issues are emulator-specific
3. Review C++ audio thread management for potential threading issues
4. Complete the JNI bridge implementation with proper error handling
5. Implement proper SFZ/SF2 instrument loading once the core audio engine works
6. Begin work on the iOS-specific implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Design**:
   - Using FFI for performance-critical operations
   - Maintaining simple, intuitive API despite complex native implementation
   - Handling errors gracefully with meaningful messages

2. **Native Implementation**:
   - Using a unified C++ core for cross-platform consistency
   - Implementing platform-specific audio output layers
   - Ensuring proper thread management for real-time audio

3. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Focusing on stability and core functionality first
   - Prioritizing robust initialization and error handling
   - Ensuring compatibility with latest Flutter versions (â‰¥3.24.0)

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implementing efficient threading model
   - Optimizing memory usage for sample loading
   - Minimizing latency in audio processing

5. **Platform Support**:
   - Android 6.0+ (API level 23+)
   - iOS 11.0+
   - Flutter 3.24.0+ 

- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust fallback mechanisms when native initialization fails
- **Performance vs. Stability**: Balancing real-time audio requirements with stability
- **Debugging Strategy**: Added extensive logging at critical points to identify issues
- **Asset Management**: Working on a consistent approach to asset loading across platforms
- **Test Coverage**: Need to implement comprehensive tests once core functionality works
