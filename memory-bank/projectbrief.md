# Project Brief: flutter_multitracker

## Overview
flutter_multitracker is an updated version of the flutter_sequencer plugin, designed to work with the latest Flutter versions. This project aims to modernize the original plugin while maintaining its core functionality and extending it with new features and improved architecture.

## Core Requirements
1. Create a fully functional audio sequencing plugin compatible with Flutter â‰¥3.7.0
2. Support SFZ format instrument playback using the sfizz library
3. Support SoundFont (SF2) format instruments
4. Support iOS AudioUnit instruments
5. Provide robust multi-track sequencing capabilities with precise timing
6. Ensure proper volume automation and control
7. Enable playback control including play, stop, loop, and position setting

## Goals
