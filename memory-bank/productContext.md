# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The original flutter_sequencer plugin was published three years ago and has not been actively maintained. Despite being marked as Dart 3 compatible, it faces compatibility issues with the latest Flutter versions. This project exists to:

1. **Provide continued access to audio sequencing capabilities** for Flutter developers
2. **Update the implementation** to work with modern Flutter versions
3. **Improve upon the original design** based on community feedback and issues
4. **Offer a reliable alternative** for developers who rely on flutter_sequencer functionality

## Problems It Solves

### For End Users
- **Audio and Music Production**: Enables mobile app users to create music and sequences with high-quality sampled instruments
- **Game Sound Effects**: Provides precise timing for sound effects in games
- **Interactive Music Applications**: Powers music learning, composition, and performance apps
- **Dynamic Soundtracks**: Enables adaptive music that responds to user actions or app states

### For Developers
- **Compatibility Issues**: Resolves compatibility problems with newer Flutter versions
- **Native Audio Access**: Provides a high-level API for complex native audio functionality
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensures consistent audio behavior across iOS and Android
- **Complex Timing**: Handles the complexities of audio scheduling and synchronization
- **Instrument Loading**: Simplifies loading and managing sample-based instruments

## How It Should Work
flutter_multitracker should provide a straightforward API that abstracts away the complexities of audio processing:

1. **Initialization**: Simple setup with minimal configuration required
2. **Instrument Management**: Easy loading and unloading of SFZ/SF2 instruments
3. **Sequence Creation**: Intuitive API for creating and modifying multi-track sequences
4. **Playback Control**: Simple controls for playing, stopping, and navigating sequences
5. **Volume Automation**: Clear methods for controlling volume dynamics
6. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

The plugin should handle all platform-specific audio implementation details while presenting a clean Dart API to developers.

## User Experience Goals
- **Reliability**: The plugin should work consistently without crashes or audio glitches
- **Performance**: Audio playback should be smooth with minimal latency
- **Flexibility**: Developers should have fine-grained control when needed
- **Simplicity**: Common tasks should be straightforward to implement
- **Transparency**: Developers should have visibility into the state of the audio engine
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful failure modes when issues occur

By focusing on these aspects, flutter_multitracker aims to become the go-to solution for audio sequencing in Flutter applications.
