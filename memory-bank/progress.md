# Progress

## What Works
- Project structure set up
- Basic Dart models defined
- Plugin framework established
- Plugin registration working
- FFI implementation started (needs optimization)
- Basic example app structure
- Fixed C++ compilation and linking errors in native code
- Native method channel communication working correctly
- Fallback audio using AudioHelper successfully implemented and playing sounds
- Visual piano key feedback in example app

## What's Left to Build
- Complete JNI implementation for Android native audio 
- Fix OpenSL ES audio initialization issues
- Complete FFI implementation for direct platform communication
- Implement native C++ audio engine with real-time processing
- Complete Android implementation with native audio
- Complete iOS implementation 
- Write comprehensive tests
- Complete documentation

## Current Status
Development phase is active. Focus is on completing the native audio engine implementation and fixing remaining issues.

Current immediate tasks:
- Fix OpenSL ES initialization issues on Android
- Debug native audio engine failures
- Troubleshoot JNI method linking issues
- Ensure correct thread management for audio processing
- Complete native audio engine features

## Critical Path Items
- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Basic Dart interface design
- [x] Basic C++ compilation working
- [x] Example app building successfully
- [x] Fix compilation errors in native code
- [x] Implement fallback audio system
- [ ] Fix native audio engine initialization
- [ ] Complete real-time audio processing
- [ ] Implement SFZ parsing and loading
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Complete platform integrations
- [ ] Write documentation

## Known Issues
### Critical
- Native audio engine fails to initialize (OpenSL ES initialization failing)
- JNI method name mismatches causing linking errors

### Important
- Package name inconsistencies between C++ and Kotlin/Java
- Asset loading path issues
- Simple implementation needs proper memory management

### Minor
- Performance optimizations needed
- More comprehensive error handling required
- Better logging and debugging needed
