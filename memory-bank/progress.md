# Progress

## What Works

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Basic Flutter plugin setup
   - Platform-specific project configuration
   - Development environment configuration

2. **Dart Models**:
   - Instrument class
   - Sequence class
   - Track class
   - Note class
   - Automation class

3. **Plugin Framework**:
   - Platform interface definition
   - Method channel implementation
   - Basic error handling

## What's Left to Build

1. **Native Implementation**:
   - Android native code
     - [ ] sfizz integration
     - [ ] Audio engine implementation
     - [ ] SFZ/SF2 file handling
   - iOS native code
     - [ ] sfizz integration
     - [ ] AVAudioEngine implementation
     - [ ] AudioUnit support
     - [ ] SFZ/SF2 file handling

2. **Dart API Implementation**:
   - [ ] Initialization and setup methods
   - [ ] Instrument loading and management
   - [ ] Sequence creation and management
   - [ ] Note creation and management
   - [ ] Playback control
   - [ ] Volume automation
   - [ ] Resource cleanup

3. **Testing**:
   - [ ] Unit tests for Dart API
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] Manual testing suite

4. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Usage examples
   - [ ] Integration guide

5. **Example App**:
   - [ ] Basic example app
   - [ ] Advanced usage examples
   - [ ] Performance demonstration

## Current Status

The project is in the **initial development phase**:

- Core model classes have been defined
- Platform interface and method channel are set up
- Basic project structure is in place
- Analysis of the original flutter_sequencer is underway

## Critical Path Items

The following items are on the critical path for initial release:

1. **Native Implementation**:
   - sfizz integration on both platforms
   - Basic audio engine functionality

2. **Core API Implementation**:
   - Instrument loading
   - Sequence playback
   - Note creation

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Cross-platform testing
   - Memory leak detection
   - Performance optimization

## Known Issues

1. **Compatibility**:
   - Need to confirm sfizz library compatibility with latest mobile platforms
   - Potential Flutter API changes in recent versions

2. **Performance**:
   - Real-time audio processing requirements need evaluation
   - Memory usage for large sample libraries needs optimization

3. **Implementation Challenges**:
   - Complex threading model for audio processing
   - Platform-specific audio implementation differences
   - Resource management for audio assets
